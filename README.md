## First Case Study: 
The sample dataset at left corner represents sales data of a icemaker machine. The customer segment includes bars, ice-cream shops, juice shop, pharma, R&D labs, etc. This is a commercial product and was launched in 2018. The sample data of 4 quarters for the year 2019 to 2022 is collected. From the first graph, we observe that the sales follow seasonality pattern. The demand for ice-maker machine is the highest in Q3 and lowest in Q4. This trend may be due to summer and winter seasons or the celebration ocassion in the country. Thus to get an udea about the performance of the product, we can deseasonalize the sample data.

The green and blue tables summarises the deseasonalised values for year 2019-2022. The seasonalised values, high and low sales for each year are determined. The chart depicts the same.

From the above analysis we can conclude that, the mean sales value is 234. The performance of the product is very good and can be seen by the increasing sales from 2019 to 2021. The demand rose and company managed to cater the demand. However, 2022 did not show good results. That may be due to increased market competition.

Conclusion: The comapny must evaluate and analyse market competition and upgrade it's product to survive their brand in the market.

## Second Case Study: 
The second product of the company is IntelliSenseSmart Refrigerator. The refrigerator has inbuilt WiFi and with it ML&AI, the refrigerator can analyse the owner's consumption patterns and can notify the stocks left and required. Also it can place order directly. From the dataset, we can roughly observe that the sales are progressively increasing. But to predict the demand of each quarter in 2023, we need to deseasonalise the data, determine the equation with maximum possible R-square value. 

Average seasonality index is calculated and accordingly, deseasonalized values are determined. The graph for each quarter from 2019-2022 is drawn and trend line is constructed with R-square = 0.8914. Thus we are able to determine seasonalised value for 4 quarters of 2023. 

Conclusion: From the past data, the linear increase in sales demand is observed. This product has made it's place in the market and can see huge demand in the futue. However, the company should now focus on excellent customer service, fixing the bugs, and decreasing the cost with time so that the product finds it's place in every home.

## Third Case Study:
The SignatureStove is used by professional chefs, restaurants, cafes, etc. It has the facility of 6 burners, and automatic temperature control, heating-cooling schedule, remote access. This high-tech stove has huge demand today. Regression statistics is carried out. The linear trend is observed with R-square = 9338 and P-value = 0. The multip R (or Pearson's R)= 0.966 indicates that sales are increasing quarter by quarter and year by year in same direction. 

The product seems to be stabilised in the market and has huge opportunities for increasing demand in future.
